# CrossAtomicSwap
Bounty to enable Cross Chain Atomic Swaps for NMC

What if in the not too distant future the demand for .bit domains takes off to the point where people are willing to pay far more for Premium names than their regular registration/renewal cost. It would be incredibly useful to have an application where either NMC or a name can be exchanged for NMC or any other coin.

Jeremy Rand Lead Developer from Namecoin proposed a while back using NAME_NEW outputs in Bisq trades as a way of (1) reducing tx fees, and (2) confusing graph analysis He has said "a lot of the BTC for names work looks very similar codewise to my Bisq proposal for NAME_NEW outputs".

I'd be willing to offer a 0.3BTC bounty for the work.

Please send me a message somehow to organize it.
